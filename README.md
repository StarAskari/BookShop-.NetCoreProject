That is the .net core Sample that will represent the outstanding technologies which is good to learn and use for real Projects.
for the architecture I have used mandentory design Patterns like Singletone, Repository, and UnitOfWork.
-Single tone design patterns, also known as Singleton design patterns, are used in projects, including those in C# .Net Core, to ensure a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system
-The Repository design pattern is used in C# .NET Core and other object-oriented programming languages to separate the logic that retrieves data from a database from the business logic that acts on the data. This pattern is used to promote a more organized codebase that is easier to maintain and test
-The Unit of Work design pattern in C# .NET Core is used to group one or more operations (usually database operations) into a single transactional scope. This means that you can ensure that all operations either complete successfully or are all rolled back if any of the operations fail, thus maintaining data consistency.
